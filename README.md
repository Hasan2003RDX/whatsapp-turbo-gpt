This code repository contains a WhatsApp chatbot built using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model and the Baileys library. This chatbot is capable of generating responses to user input based on the context of the conversation. Additionally, the chatbot has a feature to store chat history, making it more convenient to continue the conversation at a later time.
